# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using animated bar charts. Users can adjust the size of the array and the speed of the algorithm to observe how the sorting process changes.

## 🚀 Features

- Adjustable size of the array  
- Adjustable speed of the sorting algorithm  
- Real-time color-coded visualization:
  - 🟦 Blue: Unsorted elements
  - 🔴 Red: Elements being compared
  - 🟨 Yellow: Elements being swapped
  - 🟩 Green: Sorted elements
- Multiple sorting algorithms supported:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- User-friendly dark-themed UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

⚙️ Challenges Faced
Smooth animation while keeping UI responsive

Handling multiple sorting algorithms with shared visual logic

Ensuring clarity of color representation for each step

🚧 Future Improvements
Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Radix Sort, Shell Sort)

Add audio feedback while sorting

Make the site mobile-friendly

Add time and space complexity information dynamically
